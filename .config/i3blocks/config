# The package does not include default scripts anymore. All scripts have been moved to the i3blocks-contrib repository. The i3blocks repository only contains the core C program from now on, as well as a minimal system-wide configuration file to simplify package maintainers life.
# Also note that the label property does not include a space anymore, it has to be added by the user explicitly explicitly. It is also likely to be deprecated in the future.
